# React Chess

This was a project to teach myself react.js. I built a chess app that runs on a website. It currently is all local.

## Todos
* Add checker for En Passant
* Add time control
* Add checker for check and checkmate
* Allow gameplay across browsers

## Forking and running your own version

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Then go to localhost:3000 to see your own version of the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
