# React Chess

This was a project to teach myself react.js. I built a chess app that runs on a website. It currently is all local. I learned how components work, and how to control state by developing this app.
It currently checks for valid moves and switches turns.

A working version of the game is hosted at https://sukhmai.github.io/react-chess/.

## Todos
* Add checker for En Passant
* Add time control
* Add checker for check and checkmate
* Allow gameplay across browsers

## Forking and running your own version

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see your own version of the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
